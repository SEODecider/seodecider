    For the fourth year in a row, TurboTax is our top pick because it’s the closest you can get to an interview with an expert without having to pay by the hour. Its attractive interface, logical topic organization, and conversational tone make entering your data more comfortable than in any other software we tested. Other tax software can leave you wondering if you’ve missed a step, but TurboTax’s understandable explanations of complex tax terms and ample support resources assure that even novice users can do their taxes right. Like many tax-prep providers, Intuit made considerable improvements to security features last year to help prevent fraudulent returns. As for the cost, you can file the simplest returns for free, but TurboTax is quick to add fees for what should be basic features—its biggest downside. Overall we don’t have many negative things to say about the return-filing portion of TurboTax, but we aren’t impressed by its confusing sales interruptions and upsells, as well as some of Intuit’s broader business practices.
